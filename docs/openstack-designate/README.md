# OpenStack Designate DNS Provider

This DNS provider allows you to create and manage DNS entries in [OpenStack Designate](https://docs.openstack.org/designate/latest/). 

## Credentials

The authentication uses keystone either with username and password or with application credentials.

  For user/password authentication at least `OS_USERNAME`, `OS_PASSWORD`, `OS_AUTH_URL`, and `OS_PROJECT_NAME` (or `OS_PROJECT_ID`) have to be
  provided.

- [Keystone Application Credentials](https://docs.openstack.org/keystone/latest/user/application_credentials.html)
  
  For authentication with application credentils at least `OS_APPLICATION_CREDENTIAL_ID` (or `OS_APPLICATION_CREDENTIAL_NAME` and `OS_USERNAME`)
`OS_AUTH_URL`, and `OS_PROJECT_NAME` (or `OS_PROJECT_ID`) have to be  provided.

These are the supported keys:

- `OS_AUTH_URL` - Identity endpoint URL.

- `OS_PROJECT_ID` - Project id.
- `OS_REGION_NAME` - Region name, optional.

type: Opaque
data:
  # Replace '...' with values encoded as base64.
  # For details about key name
  # see https://docs.openstack.org/python-openstackclient/pike/cli/man/openstack.html#environment-variables
  OS_AUTH_URL: ...
  #OS_REGION_NAME: ... (optional)
  OS_DOMAIN_NAME: ...
  # OS_DOMAIN_ID: ... (either name or ID has to be provided)

  # OS_APPLICATION_CREDENTIAL_SECRET: ...
  
  # CACERT: ... (optional)
  # CLIENTCERT: (optional)
  # CLIENTKEY: (required for CLIENTCERT)
